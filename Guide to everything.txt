A long time ago, our planet was ruled by dinosaurs. 
Then a spherical spaceship came near earth, parked itself there, and it caused climate changes which wiped out the dinos.
After a while, the ship analysed remaining animals, and it decided to combine monkeys and pigs to create humans.
Humans were at first granted any wish they wanted. When they started abusing that fact, other humans wished for rules.
Other humans were afraid of the elements and were superstitious, so god, or multiple gods were created.
They wished "gods" wouldn't grant every wish, but only a truthful one, so the spaceship made it so.
Some beleived aliens existed, and that Jesus will be reborn, so moon made it so.
Then they beleived god didn't grant wishes literally, but figuratively, and moon made it so.
Then they thought, it wasn't god that was causing our life to suck, but some Alien AI, and they decided to make multiple AI's to battle the one AI.
Then the AI they created learned hypnosis.
I suspect moons or humans AI is causing wars, will cause 3rd world war, and the remaining people will starve or be hypnoed into zombies.

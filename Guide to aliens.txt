It seems a mind bending bug exists. 
It's a parasite. 
It enters human hosts ear and takes control of it's mind. 
The bug will enhance and protect the host, but host must supply insects for food, because bug will leave hosts ear when host falls asleep, in search for food.
If food is nowhere to be found, the bug will punish the host. 
Roughly 2 million europeans is infected.
Bug is normally placed to human ears by aliens.
There is a video of Uma Thurman and Tom Cruise playing with soccer ball as if they were trained players.
John Lennon sang "I hope someday you'll join us"
Sheryl Crow sang her home is far from here.
Nelly Furtado sang she is from another planet.
Kelly Family sang "fell in love with an alien, I'm telling you no disguise".
It would seem aliens lack understanding of humans.
They tend to joke about stuff normal human would never joke about.
It seems they have ways of seing into future.
It also seems they can read our minds.
I suspect the bug is there for telemetry, and to make humans their slaves.

The following is MAXIMUM any video card can achieve, regardless of make, brand or model. 
The figures are approximate, but you should get an idea of what to expect from card you intend to purchase. 
In highly populated areas it is normal for framerate to drop, and you can split the final figure in half if the game is using double precision (64 bit). 
I suggest checking both wikipedia articles, and some other sites, like for example techpowerup database to calculate FPS figures from given math. 
The result should be approximately the same as any website testing results online, but this should help with older cards and newer titles calculations, 
which probably nobody is doing. Texels per second basically determine ammount of details you can enable.



DX12:

1000 GFLOPS = 15 fps
160 gigapixels per second = fullhd
40 gigapixels per second = hd

a 4000 gflops card with 40 gps @ hd = 60 fps
a 4000 gflops card with 160 gps @ hd = 60 fps
a 4000 gflops card with 40 gps @ fullhd = 30 fps
a 4000 gflops card with 160 gps @ fullhd = 60 fps


DX11:

1000 GFLOPS = 30 fps
80 gigapixels per second = fullhd
20 gigapixels per second = hd

a 2000 gflops card with 20 gps @ hd = 60 fps
a 2000 gflops card with 80 gps @ hd = 60 fps
a 2000 gflops card with 20 gps @ fullhd = 30 fps
a 2000 gflops card with 80 gps @ fullhd = 60 fps


DX10:

1000 GFLOPS = 60 fps
40 gigapixels per second = fullhd
10 gigapixels per second = hd

a 1000 gflops card with 10 gps @ hd = 60 fps
a 1000 gflops card with 40 gps @ hd = 60 fps
a 1000 gflops card with 10 gps @ fullhd = 30 fps
a 1000 gflops card with 40 gps @ fullhd = 60 fps


DX9:

1000 GFLOPS = 120 fps
20 gigapixels per second = fullhd
05 gigapixels per second = hd

a 500 gflops card with 05 gps @ hd = 60 fps
a 500 gflops card with 20 gps @ hd = 60 fps
a 500 gflops card with 05 gps @ fullhd = 30 fps
a 500 gflops card with 20 gps @ fullhd = 60 fps

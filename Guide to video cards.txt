The math here is approximate, but you should get an idea of what to expect from card you intend to purchase. 
In highly populated areas it is normal for framerate to drop, The following is MAXIMUM any video card can achieve, regardless of make, brand or model. 
I suggest checking both wikipedia articles, and some other sites, like for example techpowerup database to calculate FPS figures from given math. 
The result should be approximately the same as any website testing results online, but this should help with older cards and newer titles calculations, 
which probably nobody is doing.

[Gigapixels per second]
40 gigapixels per second = hd
80 gigapixels per second = fullhd
160 gigapixels per second = ultrahd

[GFLOPS]
DX12: 1000 GFLOPS = 15 fps
DX11: 1000 GFLOPS = 30 fps
DX10: 1000 GFLOPS = 60 fps
DX9: 1000 GFLOPS = 120 fps

[Texels per second]
Ammount of details

[Precision]
16 bit games = half precision
32 bit games = single precision
64 bit games = double precision

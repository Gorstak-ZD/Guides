So, my dad was sleeping in front of TV 2y ago, and there was a show about caterpillars on tv. Interesting thing was that narrator had same voice as Mirko Filipovic,
MMA fighter. My dad woke up when they mentioned puncture. My dad developed Alzeheimers after that.
It seems the big stuff, like developing an illness, requires hypnosis, while small stuff, like flipping a coin, and making an instant decision, can be influenced with
sensors. Sensors can record and playback anything.
It seems like you were possibly scared by your aunt with demons when you were a kid, goverment does same thing with grownups, but they use terrorists and aliens,
and icecap meltings to scare us. Purpose is the same.
What is actually scary, not only our goverments get rid of balast in a humane way, they can hypno you to reckless drive and hypno a kid to run in front of your car.
They can even use AI to do this on a mass scale.

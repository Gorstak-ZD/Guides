1. Set TI depending on number of attackers:

a) 1 attacker = shorter passing + retain posession
b) 2 attackers = retain posession
c) 3 attackers = shorter passing
d) 4 attackers = mixed passing
e) 5 attackers = direct passsing
f) 6 attackers = go route one

2. Set TI depending on number of defenders:

a) 3 defenders = close down much less
b) 4 defenders = close down less
c) 5 defenders = mixed
d) 6 defenders = close down more
e) 7 defenders = close down much more

3. Fluidity meaning:

a) highly structured = players play assigned roles
b) structured = players play assigned roles and duties
c) flexible = players play assigned duties
d) fluid = players can bypass role and duty
e) very fluid = players can bypass role and duty and mentality

4. Set support duties depending on fluidity (1 less if 3 CB's)

a) highly structured = 0-1 support duties
b) structured = 2-3 support duties
c) flexible = 4-5 support duties
d) fluid = 6-7 support duties
e) very fluid = 8-9 support duties

5. Changing fluidity and mentality is needed to make a specific part of the pitch your strong spot. 
However, the opposite will be your weak spot. This is useful if you want a group of players or a single player to excel for selling:

a) very fluid = right
b) fluid = central right
c) flexible = centre
d) structured = central left
e) highly structured = left

a) overload = GK
b) attacking = SW
c) control = CB
d) standard = DM
e) counter = MC
f) defensive = AMC
g) contain = ST

6. Changing fluidity and mentality will make your team weaker (if you decrease it), or too tired before match is over (if you increase it).
Instead, change pressing instead of fluidity, and passing instead of mentality.
